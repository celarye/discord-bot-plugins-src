> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in **very early development**. While it is open source,
> it is **not open to contributions** just yet. This will change once the
> discord bot reaches version `v0.1.0`.
> The current goal is for it to reach `v0.1.0` sometime in early to mid October.

> [!WARNING]
> The current commit history will **frequently be rewritten** until `v0.1.0` of
> the discord bot is released.
